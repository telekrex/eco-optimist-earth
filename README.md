# eco-optimist-earth
Primarily to serve inspiration, this repository['s `README.md`] is a collection of ideas for making the human world more sustainable and respectful of nature. As well as that, a list of any currently active projects that people have the ability to contribute to financially. This is open to contribution and collaboration from anyone. GitHub may not necessarily be the place for the contents of this document to reach the public, but perhaps this could serve as a reliable source for those with the voice to do so.
